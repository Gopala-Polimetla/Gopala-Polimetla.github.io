#### Basic Interview question

1. What is Git ?

    Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

    Git allows and encourages you to have multiple local branches that can be entirely independent of each other. The creation, merging, and deletion of those lines of development takes seconds.

    Unlike the other systems, Git has something called the "staging area" or "index". This is an intermediate area where commits can be formatted and reviewed before completing the commit.
